# Benzaiten

[Live Preview]

I made this web application as an exercise to learn more about React as well as its interactions with various services.

##

The whole project was made from scratch with React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL (graphql-request + [AniList's API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/)), and icons from React Icons. The design is mostly based on the original AniChart site with some personal touches. Vite was used to minize development time.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run dev
```
